            <h3>Dream to become a Junior Developer</h3>
            <p>I am Imtiaz Ahmed. I am a video editor. I want to be a developer now. God willing! I will become a
                developer
                in a few days. To become a developer, I started the course of Jhangkar Mahbub Sir, and I am continuing
                it. You might saw me jumping, climbing buildings, and stopping trains. But nobody pays me a dime for
                that work. That's why I am learning and mastering web development. I will not stop until I become the
                Web Development Hero.

            <h1> Dream Big</h1>
            <h2>Become a web-developer</h2>
            <p>I already learned the basic HTML and CSS. I can build any simple website. I can even teach my younger
                ones about how to make simple website. My goal is to build 3 websites and learn advanced topics. I'll be
                a Maron stack developer. I will do my best for him. Insha Allah! Allah will give me success. Now I can
                edit exactly the videos. My hope is that I will be a developer. I want to be much bigger. Just like
                Jhangkar Mahbub Sir.
